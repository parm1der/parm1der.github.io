    <p>Hi, I'm Parminder. A software tester by trade, I spend a lot of time thinking about how technology is changing how we interact with people, culture, media and our environment. That's where Sterotopia comes in.</p>
    <p>From ancient Greek, <span>stereo: solid </span>and <span>topia: place</span>, Stereotopia is a website with its finger on the pulse of a world enamoured with digital media. Initially intended as an outlet to test and develop my skills in HTML and CSS, the idea then grew into a creative outlet where I explore popular media, especially music. All while providing a commentary on the digital age. Dystopia or Utopia, you decide.</p>
    <p>Always looking to expand my horizons, feel free to reach out via social media or <a href="mailto:parminder.gill@pm.me?subject=Digital Coffee">e-mail</a> for a chat.</p>
